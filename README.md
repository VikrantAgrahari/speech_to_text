Speech To Text Recognition

In this project, I'm converting voice into text using Google's Speech_Recognition engine. I'd made a simple method, upload file and convert. The feautre included is 'adjust_ambient_noise' feature which is not enough for removing noise.

The features wish to include in this project is that the website 

1.  Can convert file format from popular formats to ".wav" which is one Speech_Recognition engine supports
2.  Able to remove the noise level depending on the uploaded audio.

*I'm a new face to this field, so need helping hands. You can put other features if you want to. I love learning from you ðŸ˜Š*

I like you to suggest me on my requirements if you have, You can message (If I'm lucky, please do Follow) me on

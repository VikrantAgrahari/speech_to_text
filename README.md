Speech To Text Recognition

In this project, I'm converting voice into text using Google's Speech_Recognition engine. I'd made a simple method, upload file and convert. The feature included is 'adjust_ambient_noise' feature which is not enough for removing noise.

The features wish to include in this project is that the website 

1.  Can convert file format from popular formats to ".wav" which is one Speech_Recognition engine supports
2.  Able to remove the noise level depending on the uploaded audio.
3.  User can download output in txt or doc format
4.  Make option of recording of audio (User can upload or record audio)
